Decentralized Learning

Never sent to server

Only the weights and bias'es are received by the server
	And they are averaged out to get new master model.

Need to do many iterations

Homomorhpic Encryption
	How homomorphic encryption is used in federated learning
		Data Encryption
		Model Training on Encrypted Data
		Secure Model Updates
		Decryption on Local Devices

	Advantages of Homomorhpic Encryption
		Data Privacy
		Security
		Compilance

	Challenges with using Homomorhpic Encryption
		Computational Overhead
		Key Management
		Limited Supported Operations
		Performance depends on specific encryption scheme


Intro to Homomorphic Encryption - "MicrosoftResearch" - Wei Dai - Private AI bootcamp - Dec 2, 2019
	Use mainly the BFV scheme
		Simpler way of explaining the homomorphic encryption

All data outside safe space must be encrypted.

Popular Schemes
	TFHE: logic gates on bits
	BGV, BFV: exact arithmetic on vectors of numbers 
	CKKS: approximate arithmetic on vectors of numbers

Five Stages in HE
	Setup
		Scheme
		Security parameters
		Functionality Parameters

	Key generation
		Secret Key
		Public Keys
			Public Key
			Relinearlization Key
			Galois Key

	Encryption
		A number or a vector of numbers --> A ciphertext

	Evaluation

	Decyption

Analogies
	Public Key --> Anyone can lock the door, but only one has the key
	HE --> Glove box
