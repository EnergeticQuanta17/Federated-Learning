Decentralized Learning

Never sent to server

Only the weights and bias'es are received by the server
	And they are averaged out to get new master model.

Need to do many iterations

Homomorhpic Encryption
	How homomorphic encryption is used in federated learning
		Data Encryption
		Model Training on Encrypted Data
		Secure Model Updates
		Decryption on Local Devices

	Advantages of Homomorhpic Encryption
		Data Privacy
		Security
		Compilance

	Challenges with using Homomorhpic Encryption
		Computational Overhead
		Key Management
		Limited Supported Operations
		Performance depends on specific encryption scheme
